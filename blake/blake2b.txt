Opal BLAKE2b
for Unix

This program computes hashes of files to verify data integrity.

By default, the program computes the hash of a stream of input data from
standard input.

In list mode, the program interprets standard input as a list of file names
seperated by newline characters and outputs the hash of each file followed by a
space, the file name, and a newline.

In check mode, the program reads a stream that was previously output by the
program in list mode and outputs each file name followed by either ": OK" or
": FAILED" depending on whether the hash matches.

options_
h: print help and exit
l: list mode
c: check mode
s: hash length in bytes (default: 64)
